The goal of this project was to access data from a SQLite database and display the results on a webpage with interactive visualiazations.  The application connects to the database to create routes containing the data from it and then uses JavaScript to get the data from these routes and creates different graphs to display the data. 

Please note: app.py as well as the folders are all that is needed to run the program locally. Simply run app.py.  The other files are to host the project on Heroku which can be viewed here: https://interactive-web-vis-and-dash.herokuapp.com/
